HTML5 Server-Sent Events


Server-Sent Events allow a web page to get updates from a server.

Server-Sent Events - One Way Messaging
A server-sent event is when a web page automatically gets updates from a server.

This was also possible before, but the web page would have to ask if any updates
 were available. With server-sent events, the updates come automatically.

Examples: Facebook/Twitter updates, stock price updates, news feeds, sport results, etc.



Check Server-Sent Events Support
In the tryit example above there were some extra lines of code to 
check browser support for server-sent events:


if(typeof(EventSource) !== "undefined") {
  // Yes! Server-sent events support!
  // Some code.....
} else {
  // Sorry! No server-sent events support..
}

The EventSource Object

In the examples above we used the onmessage event to get messages. 
But other events are also available:

Events	        Description
onopen	        When a connection to the server is opened
onmessage	    When a message is received
onerror  	    When an error occurs
